Overview:

This project utilizes Flask, a Python micro web framework, to deploy a machine learning model for predicting chronic kidney disease (CKD). The model is trained on a dataset consisting of 400 samples using the XGBoost classifier.

Features:

Predicts the likelihood of chronic kidney disease based on various medical parameters.
User-friendly interface for inputting medical data and obtaining predictions.
Seamless deployment using Flask, enabling easy access for healthcare professionals and patients alike.
Usage:

Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone <repository_url>
Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Flask application:

python app.py
Access the application through your web browser at the provided URL.

Model Details:

Algorithm: XGBoost Classifier
Training Data: 400 samples
Features: Various medical parameters including age, blood pressure, serum creatinine, etc.
Performance Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC
Contributing:
